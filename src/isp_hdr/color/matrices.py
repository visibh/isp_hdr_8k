"""
Color space matrices and per-camera exposure constant.
Currently, these values are DJI X9 specific and are intentionally hardcoded.
In the current form, this pipeline targets a single camera. For extension to other cameras, specific metadata needs to be extracted from the EXIF information.

Convention: matrices act on column vectors so a full image transform is:
    out = (M @ rgb.reshape(-1,3).T).T.reshape(H,W,3)
which 'apply_3x3' performs.
Inverses are always computed, never hardcoded
